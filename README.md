This repository contains our two primary python notebooks, each corresponding to the model of the specified language. For the sake of simplicity, rather than including all our experiments - with different architectures as well as hyper-parameters - we've only included our final architectures here. These results can now be replicated by simply running the entire notebook. Please ensure though that you've added our dataset to your drive. The link to the dataset is present in our paper. 

Note - the script to generate the training dataset (both Hindi and Hindi translated to English) has not been included here, since the final dataset files are already available in the given folder.
